            <p class="mb-4">We believe in transparency. Here’s a simple summary of our privacy promise.</p>
            <ul class="space-y-2">
                <li class="negative"><strong>We NEVER collect your content.</strong> The text of your clips and stashes is yours alone and remains on your device.</li>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Trace ("we," "us," "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and handling your data in an open and transparent manner. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in connection with our Trace browser extension (the "Service").</p>
        <p>This policy is designed to comply with major global privacy regulations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) as amended by the CPRA, Canada's Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA), and India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA).</p>

        <h2>2. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>For the purpose of data protection laws, the data controller is:
            <br><strong>Trace App</strong>
            <br>Contact Email: <a href="mailto:shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com">shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <h2>3. Information We Collect and Why</h2>
        <p>We believe in data minimization. We only process information that is necessary to provide and improve the Service.</p>
        
        <h3>3.1. Your Content Data (What We DON'T Collect)</h3>
        <p><strong>The content of your clips and stashes is never collected, transmitted, or stored by us.</strong> This data is processed and stored locally on your device within your browser's secure storage. We have no access to it. This is a core principle of our design.</p>

        <h3>3.2. Personal Information</h3>
        <p>We do not require you to create an account to use Trace. The core Service does not collect any Personal Information that directly identifies you, such as your name, email address, or physical address.</p>
        <p>The only exception is if you voluntarily contact us for support via email, in which case we will use your email address solely to communicate with you about your query.</p>

        <h3>3.3. Anonymized and Aggregated Usage Data (Future Collection)</h3>
        <p>To help us improve the Service, fix bugs, and prioritize new features, we plan to collect anonymized and aggregated usage data in a future version of Trace. This data is non-personal and cannot be used to identify you. It will include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>• <strong>Feature Engagement:</strong> How often core features (e.g., "mark," "stash," "search") are used.</li>
            <li>• <strong>Performance Metrics:</strong> Extension load times and search speed to help us identify and fix bottlenecks.</li>
            <li>• <strong>System Information:</strong> Browser type/version and operating system to ensure compatibility and diagnose issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Crucially, you will have the ability to opt-out of this data collection.</strong> This option will be clearly presented in the extension's settings.</p>

        <h2>4. Legal Basis for Processing</h2>
        <p>Under GDPR, we must have a legal basis to process data. For the future collection of Anonymized and Aggregated Usage Data, our legal basis will be:
            <br>• <strong>Legitimate Interest:</strong> We have a legitimate interest in understanding how our Service is used so we can improve it for all users. We ensure this interest is balanced against your rights and freedoms by only collecting non-personal, anonymized data and by providing a clear opt-out.
            <br>• <strong>Consent:</strong> By providing a clear opt-out mechanism, we are also empowering you to grant or withdraw your consent for this processing.
        </p>
        
        <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
        <p>You have rights concerning your information under various privacy laws. We are committed to upholding these rights for all users, regardless of location.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>• <strong>The Right to Be Informed:</strong> This policy informs you of our data practices.</li>
            <li>• <strong>The Right of Access:</strong> Since we don't store your personal data, this right is limited. You can access your Content Data locally within your browser.</li>
            <li>• <strong>The Right to Rectification:</strong> You can correct or update your Content Data locally.</li>
            <li>• <strong>The Right to Erasure (Deletion):</strong> You can delete your Content Data at any time by clearing the extension's storage or uninstalling it.</li>
            <li>• <strong>The Right to Withdraw Consent / Opt-Out:</strong> You will have the right to opt-out of our future anonymous data collection at any time.</li>
            <li>• <strong>The Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You have the right to lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority if you have concerns about our practices.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To exercise any rights or if you have questions, please contact us at <a href="mailto:shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com">shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com</a>.</p>
        
        <h3>5.1. Region-Specific Rights</h3>
        <p><strong>For users in California (CCPA/CPRA):</strong> We do not "sell" or "share" personal information as defined by the CCPA. The rights listed above cover your rights under California law.</p>
        <p><strong>For users in the EEA, UK, and Switzerland (GDPR):</strong> The rights listed above are your primary rights under GDPR.</p>
        <p><strong>For users in Canada (PIPEDA):</strong> This policy is intended to comply with PIPEDA's principles of accountability, consent, and openness. You have the right to access your information and challenge our compliance with the Privacy Commissioner of Canada.</p>
        <p><strong>For users in India (DPDPA):</strong> We act as the "Data Fiduciary." You have the rights outlined above. For any grievances, please contact our Grievance Officer at <a href="shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com">shreyanshpandey@protonmail.com</a>.</p>


        <h2>6. Data Security and Retention</h2>
        <p>We are committed to data security. All your Content Data is stored locally on your device. For any future anonymous data collection, we will use reputable third-party analytics services that employ industry-standard security measures, including encryption in transit and at rest. We will only retain this aggregated data for as long as it is necessary for the purpose of product improvement.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13 (or 16 in certain jurisdictions). We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children. If we become aware that we have inadvertently collected such information, we will take steps to delete it.</p>
        
        <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new policy on this page and, if applicable, through a notice within the extension or on the extension's store listing. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>
